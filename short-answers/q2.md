# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
NodeLists are static collections of anything in the document, the only array method that can be used is `forEach()`. HTMLCollections are live, does not take any array methods, and is a collection of only HTML elements. Both are not arrays, but they act like arrays due to them using zero-based indexing.

# Teacher Feedback

Make sure you answer all parts of the question, both are not arrays but have array like behavior due to indexing!
