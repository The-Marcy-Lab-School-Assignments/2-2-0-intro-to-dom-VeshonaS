# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
You would want to use `.innerHTML` to create new html when you have multiple things to add, and you can use `.createElement` to make a new element or add changes to one other element.

# Teacher Feedback

This is one possible application but typically we would want to use `.innerHTML` when we want to overwrite previous HTML and `.createElement` when we want to have a bit more control and flexibility over an element!
